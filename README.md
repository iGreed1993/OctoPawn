# OctoPawn

A lightweight item scoring and comparison addon built for OctoWoW.

OctoPawn reads the stats on gear and gives you a clear **OP Score** so you can quickly tell whether something is actually an upgrade for your role. It also keeps an always-on equip comparison that shows how the item stacks up against what you already have equipped.

### Features

* **Role-based scoring** – Pre-made weight sets for every class and common role (Arms, Fury, Protection, Holy, Retribution, Balance, Feral Cat/Bear, Restoration, etc.)
* **Immediate OP Score on tooltips** – See the score the moment you mouse over an item
* **Always-on equip comparison** – Automatically compares the hovered item against your currently equipped gear in the same slot(s)
* **Default + fully customizable stat weights** – Start with solid role defaults, then tweak any individual weight to your liking
* **Soft-cap / diminishing returns** – Built-in soft caps for stats like Hit, Spell Hit, Crit, Defense, Dodge, etc. (fully adjustable in the Advanced panel)
* Properly parses a wide range of stats, including things like Spell Hit, Casting Regen, Feral Attack Power, Armor Penetration, and many others
* OP Score shown on your character paperdoll and when inspecting other players
* Minimap button + simple config UI
* Per-character saved settings
